# Opinionated styling rules for PHP-CS-Fixer

![CI](https://github.com/timacdonald/php-style/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

These are the rules applied across my personal projects and open source packages.

## Installation

You can install using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) from [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/timacdonald/php-style).

```
$ composer require timacdonald/php-style:dev-master --dev
```

## Basic usage

In your `.php_cs.dist` config file...

```php
<?php

// specify the paths to fix, as normal...

$finder = PhpCsFixer\Finder::create()
    ->in(__DIR__.'/src')
    ->in(__DIR__.'/tests');

// then call and return the following global function...

return TiMacDonald\styles($finder);
```

## Thanksware

You are free to use this package, but I ask that you reach out to someone (not me) who has previously, or is currently, maintaining or contributing to an open source library you are using in your project and thank them for their work. Consider your entire tech stack: packages, frameworks, languages, databases, operating systems, frontend, backend, etc.
